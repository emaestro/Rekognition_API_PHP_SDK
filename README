Current Version: 1.0

Configuration:
------------

- Register an API key from https://www.rekognition.com/register/, and you will receive API key and secret by email.

- Edit account information in config.php under Path/to/Project/Rekognition/:
   
  $rekognition_api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
  $rekognition_api_secret = 'YOUR_SECRET';
  
- Setup API callbacks   

  $rekognition_jobs = 'face_part_gender_emotion_age_glass_mouth,scene';
  $rekognition_name_space = '';
  $rekognition_user_id = '';
  
  API classes are separated by ',', and subclasses are separated by '_'. $rekognition_name_space and $rekognition_user_id are used when you need facial recognition function.

- Now check whether Rekognition API has been successfully configured by running our two examples:

  - Analyze image and draw detected faces
    http://www.example.com/rekognition/example/Image_Request_Example.php and
    
  - Parse image analysis results (JSON) from Rekognition server
    print out face, e.g, age, smile or not, male or female, with glass or not, etc,
    and scene information, e.g. indoor, beach, etc.

  If your webpage prints out all the information successfully, congratulations! You could use Rekognition API in ANY of your PHP code now.
